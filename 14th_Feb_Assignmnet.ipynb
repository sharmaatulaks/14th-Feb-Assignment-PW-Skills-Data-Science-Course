    "Ans 1:- Multithreading in Python refers to the ability to run multiple threads (or sequences of code execution) concurrently within a single program. This means that instead of running one sequence of instructions at a time, the program can run multiple sequences of instructions at the same time, allowing for potentially faster and more efficient code execution.\n",

    "Multithreading is used when a program needs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, in handling user input and in also performing complex calculations or running network requests in the background. It is also used to improve the performance of CPU-intensive tasks by allowing them to run on multiple CPU cores simultaneously.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Performance: Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby increasing its overall performance. By executing multiple threads concurrently, the program can achieve faster response times, improved throughput, and better utilization of available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing: Multithreading allows multiple threads to share resources such as memory, CPU time, and input/output devices. This reduces the overhead of creating and maintaining separate processes for each task, thereby improving efficiency and reducing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of user interfaces and other interactive applications by allowing them to continue processing user input while performing other tasks in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Multithreading makes it easier to scale an application to handle larger workloads by taking advantage of additional processing power and resources on multicore systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreaded programs are often more complex and harder to develop and debug than single-threaded programs. This is due to the need to manage synchronization, race conditions, deadlocks, and other concurrency-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Multithreading introduces additional overhead in terms of context switching, synchronization, and communication between threads. This can reduce performance and increase the risk of contention for shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization: Synchronizing access to shared resources can be difficult and error-prone, leading to issues such as deadlocks and livelocks. This can be especially challenging in large, complex systems with many interacting threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portability: Multithreading can be difficult to implement and debug on different operating systems and hardware platforms, due to differences in thread scheduling, synchronization primitives, and other system-level factors."

    "Ans 6:- Deadlocks and race conditions are two common types of concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked and waiting for each other to release resources they are holding, resulting in a situation where none of the threads can proceed. This can happen when two or more threads hold locks on resources that each other needs, or when a thread tries to acquire multiple locks in a different order than another thread. Deadlocks can cause programs to become unresponsive and require manual intervention to resolve.\n",

    "In this scenario, both threads are blocked waiting for the other to release the lock they need, resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Race conditions occur when two or more threads access shared resources concurrently and the final result depends on the order of execution of the threads. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and incorrect results. Race conditions can occur when threads do not synchronize access to shared resources, or when one thread assumes a certain state of the system while another thread changes that state.\n",
